The template can be operated using [[Commands|Template Commands]].

Templates involve two distinct phases:
1. **Compiling**: This involves the transformation of all variables into their corresponding values and the execution of various commands.
2. **Running**: In this phase, the compiled template is dispatched to **LLMs** to obtain the output.
