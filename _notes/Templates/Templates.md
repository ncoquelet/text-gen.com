To start using text generator templates we recommend start by using [[Playground]]. 
Template playground you can get an idea the available context and commands in the scripting language of the template which is based on [[Handlebars]] with additional options. 


In templates, we distinguish two processes: 
1. **Compiling** : converting all variables to their values and run the different commands. 
2. **Running**: sending the compiled version to a **LLMs** and get the result.
