## Page Navigation

Obsidian Publish allow to [customize the order of notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Customize+your+site#Customize+navigation) in the File Explorer plugin. To date, it must be do manually in the published site options.

We can adjust note order within folders (including the vault root), and folder order within other folders. 
But we can't move files from one folder to another.
